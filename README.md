✅ One-tap power, speed, breeze, and light controls
✅ Mock Mode (no backend required) for instant demos
✅ Material 3 theming, dark mode, tasteful gradients
✅ Clean architecture with domain/data/presentation layers

## 🧠 UI & Flow (Visual Overview)

```
Splash → Login → Device List (Grid) → Device Control (Actions)
```

Each screen is optimized for clarity, motion, and quick interaction.

---

## 🔄 Mock Mode → Real API (Step-by-Step)

Start in Mock Mode, then enable live data when ready:

```
device_list_screen.dart
	• initState(): uncomment provider fetch/startAutoRefresh
	• _onRefresh(): uncomment provider fetch

device_control_screen.dart
	• Uncomment provider control calls (power/speed/light/breeze)

api_constants.dart
	• Adjust base URL or headers if needed
```

## ▶️ Quick Start

```bash
flutter pub get
```

Run in Mock Mode:

```bash
# Web
flutter run -d chrome

# Android/iOS
flutter run
```

Run tests (optional):

```bash
flutter test
```

## 🏗️ Why This Stands Out

✔️ Designed to impress quickly (animations, gradients, clean layout)
✔️ Real architecture, not throwaway code
✔️ Mock-first for instant demos; API-ready by design
✔️ Minimal friction to onboard and showcase

---

## 🧪 Future Enhancements

* Connect real fan images in `assets/images`
* Auto-refresh dashboard metrics with provider
* Device grouping, rooms, favorites
* Web build optimizations
